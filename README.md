India’s Growth vs Reality (1990–2024)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes India’s long-term economic growth using official World Bank data to examine whether rising GDP has translated into improved economic well-being for individuals.

Rather than focusing only on headline GDP growth, the analysis compares:

Aggregate economic growth

Per-capita income trends

Inflation dynamics across different policy eras

The goal is to bridge the gap between macro-level growth narratives and on-ground economic reality.

📊 Key Questions Explored

How has India’s GDP evolved from 1990 to 2024?

Has GDP per capita grown proportionally with overall GDP?

How do inflation patterns differ before and after 2014?

Does strong GDP growth necessarily imply improved quality of life?

🧠 Key Insights

India’s GDP has grown significantly over time, particularly after 2014.

GDP per capita has increased at a slower pace, highlighting distributional challenges.

Inflation patterns differ meaningfully across policy eras, impacting economic stability.

High GDP growth does not automatically translate into proportional improvements in individual economic well-being.
